#      CORAZA_RELEASE, CORAZA_CHART_REPO, CORAZA_IMAGE_REPO/TAG,
#      CORAZA_CRD_REF, CORAZA_CRD_DIR (defaults in lib.sh)
#
# The image is resolved rather than taken from the chart because the chart's
# ghcr.io release is linux/amd64 only, so on arm64 the pod never starts. That
# makes the CRD source a consequence, not a separate choice: the resolved tag
# is a commit in CORAZA_BUILD_REPO, and the CRDs at that commit are the ones
# the running manager expects.
#
# CORAZA_IMAGE_REPO / CORAZA_IMAGE_TAG run a build of your own and opt out of
# both. Set CORAZA_CRD_DIR with them, pointing at the config/crd/bases of the
# revision that image was built from: the chart's CRDs are pinned to the chart,
# a newer operator needs fields they do not define, and the mismatch surfaces
# three steps later as a RuleSet that never goes Ready.
# See 'Image and CRDs' in docs/prerequisites.md.
#
# This installs a release build. To test operator changes you have not shipped,
# use 'make deploy' in the operator repo instead and skip this script.
