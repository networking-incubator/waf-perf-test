# Env knobs:
#   FAILURE_POLICY=fail|allow        Engine failure policy (default: fail).
#   POLL_CACHE=true                  Enable cache polling (ruleSetCacheServer);
#                                    default is static-embedded rules.
#   POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS=15         Poll cadence when POLL_CACHE=true.
#   WASM_WAIT_TIMEOUT=60             Seconds 'off' waits for the WasmPlugin to
#                                    be withdrawn; it exits non-zero if it is
#                                    still attached, so no caller measures a
#                                    baseline through a live WAF filter.
