# Prerequisites

What the cluster needs before `scripts/setup.sh`, and the scripts that install
it. Everything here is a **one-time cluster change**, not part of a run — see
[When not to run these](#when-not-to-run-these).

```bash
scripts/prereqs/check.sh           # what is missing, in about two seconds
scripts/prereqs/install-all.sh     # install it, then re-check
```

`install-all.sh` is the default route and needs no arguments or environment:
it detects the platform and takes the path that platform expects. It is
re-runnable — each step is a no-op when its piece is already there.

---

## What is required, and why

| Piece | Why the harness needs it |
|---|---|
| Gateway API CRDs | `manifests/gateway.yaml` is a `Gateway` + `HTTPRoute` |
| Istio control plane with a GatewayClass | The Gateway pod *is* the Envoy under test |
| `WasmPlugin` CRD (`extensions.istio.io`) | How `coraza-proxy-wasm` reaches that Envoy |
| Coraza Kubernetes Operator | Owns `Engine`/`RuleSet`/`RuleSource`, which `waf.sh` toggles |
| `ServiceMonitor` CRD | Optional. Only `scripts/collect.sh` uses it |

`setup.sh` checks none of this. It applies the Gateway and waits for a
`Programmed` condition that, without a GatewayClass, never arrives — so a
missing prerequisite presents as a hang, not an error. Run `check.sh` first.

---

## PLATFORM, and when to set it

`lib.sh` derives both the CLI and the gateway class from it:

| `PLATFORM` | CLI | `GATEWAY_CLASS` |
|---|---|---|
| `kubernetes` | `kubectl` | `istio` |
| `openshift` | `oc` | `openshift-default` |

Leave it unset and it is detected, by asking the cluster for the
`route.openshift.io` API — every script does this, not just the prereq ones.
Each prints which platform it is using and whether that was detected or taken
from the variable.

Set it only to override a correct detection, which in practice means one case:
Istio installed by hand on OpenShift rather than by the ingress operator, where
the gateway class is `istio` on an OpenShift cluster. Overriding earns a
warning, since an accidental override and a deliberate one look identical from
inside a script.

---

## OpenShift

The cluster ingress operator owns Istio here. You do not install it — you
create a GatewayClass with the controller it watches, and it installs OSSM and
an Istio control plane for you:

```bash
oc apply -f - <<'EOF'
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: GatewayClass
metadata:
  name: openshift-default
spec:
  controllerName: openshift.io/gateway-controller/v1
EOF

oc wait --for=condition=Accepted gatewayclass/openshift-default --timeout=600s
```

That is all `scripts/prereqs/install-istio.sh` does on OpenShift, plus waiting
for the `WasmPlugin` CRD to appear — OLM resolution takes minutes, well past
the point where it looks stuck.

**Do not install Istio by hand on OpenShift.** A second control plane is not
the one the managed gateway follows, and the WAF never loads.

### Versions are the cluster's choice, not yours

The ingress operator pins them in its own deployment:

```bash
oc get deploy ingress-operator -n openshift-ingress-operator \
  -o jsonpath='{range .spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[*]}{.name}={.value}{"\n"}{end}' \
  | grep -E 'ISTIO_VERSION|GATEWAY_API_OPERATOR'
```

On OpenShift 4.22.14 that reads `servicemeshoperator3.v3.3.1` and Istio
`v1.28.5`. Read them off the cluster and put them in the report by hand —
`generate-report.py` hardcodes someone else's versions and will not correct
itself.

### Gateway API CRDs

Shipped and reconciled by the cluster. `install-gateway-api.sh` refuses to run
on OpenShift rather than fight the ingress operator.

---

## Kubernetes

```bash
scripts/prereqs/install-gateway-api.sh   # kubectl kustomize ...gateway-api/config/crd?ref=v1.4.1
scripts/prereqs/install-istio.sh         # istioctl install --set profile=minimal
```

`istioctl` is downloaded at `ISTIO_VERSION` if it is not already on PATH; if it
is, that binary's version wins and the script says so. istiod creates the
`istio` GatewayClass once the Gateway API CRDs exist, which is why the order
matters.

The profile is `minimal`, not `demo`: the demo profile adds telemetry addons
that compete for CPU with the proxy under test.

---

## The operator

Installed from the chart the operator repo's release CI publishes, so this
needs no operator checkout:

```bash
helm repo add coraza-kubernetes-operator \
  https://networking-incubator.github.io/coraza-kubernetes-operator/
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install coraza-kubernetes-operator \
  coraza-kubernetes-operator/coraza-kubernetes-operator \
  --namespace coraza-system --create-namespace \
  --set openshift.enabled=true \
  --set istio.revision=openshift-gateway \
  --set metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled=true
```

**The last three flags are not optional on OpenShift.** They are what the
chart's own [OpenShift
section](https://github.com/networking-incubator/coraza-kubernetes-operator/tree/main/charts/coraza-kubernetes-operator#openshift)
supplies as `examples/openshift-values.yaml`; set this way they render
identically. Without them `helm template` differs in three places:

- `runAsUser: 65532` and `fsGroup: 65532` stay in the pod security context,
  instead of being omitted so the SCC can assign OpenShift's own UID.
- The manager loses `--istio-revision=openshift-gateway`. That revision must
  match the control plane the ingress operator created — check it with
  `oc get deploy -n openshift-ingress | grep istiod`. Against the wrong
  revision the operator writes a WasmPlugin no gateway proxy is watching, and
  you measure a WAF that never ran, which [guardrail
  6](../README.md#methodology) exists to catch.
- No ServiceMonitor, so `collect.sh` has nothing to scrape.

On Kubernetes, drop all three.

`install-operator.sh` passes exactly these, and omits the ServiceMonitor one
when that CRD is absent. It also departs from the command above in what it
installs: not the chart's default image, and not the chart's CRDs — see [Image
and CRDs](#image-and-crds).

**Pin the chart version for anything you intend to report:**

```bash
CORAZA_CHART_VERSION=0.5.0 scripts/prereqs/install-operator.sh
```

Unpinned, you get whatever is newest in the index that day, and two runs a week
apart may not share an operator.

To test operator changes you have not released, use `make deploy` from the
operator repo instead and skip this script.

### Image and CRDs

**The chart's ghcr.io release image is `linux/amd64` only.** Every tag through
`v0.5.0` is a single-platform index, so on an arm64 cluster — CRC on Apple
Silicon, say — the pod never starts:

```
no image found in image index for architecture "arm64", variant "v8", OS "linux"
```

So `install-operator.sh` does not use it. With `CORAZA_IMAGE_REPO` unset it
calls `resolve-operator-image.sh`, which reads the architecture off the cluster
nodes and picks the newest Konflux build that actually publishes it — that
pipeline produces `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`. The repository is public, so
the cluster pulls it directly: no local build, no loading into the node, and
nothing to set.

```bash
scripts/prereqs/install-operator.sh     # resolves the image by itself
```

Run the resolver alone to see what it would pick. Progress goes to stderr and
stdout is exactly the two `export` lines, so it composes:

```bash
scripts/prereqs/resolve-operator-image.sh                        # just look
eval "$(ARCH=amd64 scripts/prereqs/resolve-operator-image.sh)"   # or pin an arch
```

**The CRDs follow the image, not the chart.** Each build is tagged with its
commit in `CORAZA_BUILD_REPO`, and that commit carries the CRDs the manager
expects, so the script applies those instead. It has to: chart 0.5.0 ships
`rulesources` and `ruledata` with no status subresource and an `engines`
without `spec.observability`. A manager that new against CRDs that old fails
as status patches reporting the object missing when it is the schema that is
behind — an error that names the object, not the schema, and sends you looking
in the wrong place. `check.sh` asserts both CRDs serve `/status` so this costs
seconds rather than an afternoon.

They are applied *before* `helm upgrade`, and the install passes `--skip-crds`
so helm does not also try. Helm 4 does not skip CRDs that already exist — it
applies them server-side, which collides with the field manager of whoever
applied them first and aborts the install outright:

```
conflict with "kubectl-client-side-apply": .spec.versions
```

The harness applies with `--server-side --field-manager=waf-perf-test
--force-conflicts` for the same reason: a CRD left behind by an earlier
client-side apply gets taken over rather than fought with.

**This is how to get running, not how to produce a number.** Know what you are
taking on:

- **It is a staging registry.** Tags are commit SHAs and `on-pr-<sha>` builds,
  and they are garbage-collected. There is no `latest`; the registry returns
  `MANIFEST_UNKNOWN` for it. The images carry `version: unknown`.
- **It is a different source line.** Its `vcs-ref` is not a commit in
  `networking-incubator/coraza-kubernetes-operator`, and no matching chart
  exists in the published Helm index.

So the chart version alone no longer describes what ran. The script prints the
chart, the resolved image **digest** — read back from the pod, because a
commit-SHA tag in a staging registry can be rebuilt or collected — and the CRD
commit. Record all three.

#### Build it yourself

Setting `CORAZA_IMAGE_REPO` / `CORAZA_IMAGE_TAG` opts out of the resolution,
and with it the CRD pairing. Set `CORAZA_CRD_DIR` alongside them, pointing at
`config/crd/bases` in the checkout the image was built from; the installer
warns if you do not. `CORAZA_CRD_REF` takes the downstream CRDs at a named
commit instead.

Build for your architecture from the operator repo and point the harness at it:

```bash
cd <coraza-kubernetes-operator>
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t localhost/coraza-kubernetes-operator:dev .

# CRC has no registry you can push to by default; load into the VM's
# container storage, which CRI-O shares with podman:
docker save localhost/coraza-kubernetes-operator:dev -o /tmp/op.tar
scp -i ~/.crc/machines/crc/id_ed25519 -P 2222 /tmp/op.tar core@127.0.0.1:/tmp/
ssh -i ~/.crc/machines/crc/id_ed25519 -p 2222 core@127.0.0.1 'sudo podman load -i /tmp/op.tar'

CORAZA_IMAGE_REPO=localhost/coraza-kubernetes-operator CORAZA_IMAGE_TAG=dev \
CORAZA_CRD_DIR=<coraza-kubernetes-operator>/config/crd/bases \
  scripts/prereqs/install-operator.sh
```

The `localhost/` prefix matters: it tells CRI-O the image is already in local
storage, and the chart's default `pullPolicy: IfNotPresent` then leaves it
alone. It only works on single-node CRC: with more than one node the image
exists on whichever node you loaded it into and nowhere else, so the pod
starts or hits `ImagePullBackOff` depending on where it schedules. On a real
cluster, push to a registry it can reach.

#### Recording which image ran

The chart renders the image as `"{{ repository }}:{{ tag }}"` with no digest
field, so a `@sha256:` reference cannot be passed through `CORAZA_IMAGE_TAG`.
That matters most for Option 1, where a commit-SHA tag in a staging registry
can be rebuilt or collected out from under you.

`install-operator.sh` reads the resolved reference back off the running pod and
prints it:

```
==> Running image: quay.io/…/waf-operator@sha256:163f2b10abf…
```

Record that digest alongside the chart version. It is the only thing that still
identifies the binary once the tag is gone.

#### Pair the CRDs with the image

**Set `CORAZA_CRD_DIR` whenever you set `CORAZA_IMAGE_REPO`.** The image and
the CRDs ship together and only match when both come from the same revision.
Helm applies the chart's `crds/` on first install and never again, so a build
newer than the chart ends up running against the chart's schema. Published
chart 0.5.0 defines `rulesources` and `ruledata` without a `status`
subresource; an operator built after that writes RuleSource status to an
endpoint the API server does not serve, and every patch comes back:

```
rulesources.waf.k8s.coraza.io "base-rules" not found
```

Which names the object, not the schema. Three steps later it surfaces as a
RuleSet stuck on `AwaitingRuleSourceValidation` and `waf.sh on` timing out:

```
error: timed out waiting for the condition on rulesets/perf-ruleset
```

`install-operator.sh` warns when it sees a local image with no
`CORAZA_CRD_DIR`, and `check.sh` asserts both CRDs serve `/status`, so this
costs seconds to spot rather than an afternoon.

---

## Beyond the CRDs

`check.sh` cannot see these, and without them you are measuring CPU throttling
rather than the WAF:

- **Dedicated node pools** for the load generator, the Gateway, and the backend.
- **Guaranteed QoS** — CPU requests equal to limits — on all three.
- **Prometheus** reachable, with the operator's ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor
  enabled, if you want `collect.sh` to return anything.

See [Environment requirements](../README.md#environment-requirements) and
[Confounders and risks](../README.md#confounders-and-risks).

---

## When not to run these

Not between a baseline and a WAF-on run. Installing or upgrading Istio restarts
the gateway proxy, which breaks the same-session comparison every number in
this harness depends on. Install first, verify with `check.sh`, then start the
session.

---

## Uninstalling

`scripts/teardown.sh` removes only the `waf-perf` namespace, which is usually
what you want between sessions.

To also remove the operator:

```bash
scripts/prereqs/uninstall-operator.sh              # prompts for the namespace
scripts/prereqs/uninstall-operator.sh --keep-crds  # leave the CRDs installed
```

It does the test namespace, the Helm release, `coraza-system`, the
supplementary RBAC, and the four `waf.k8s.coraza.io` CRDs — in that order,
which matters. Engines carry a finalizer only the operator clears, so the
custom resources have to go while the operator is still watching. Remove the
operator first and the namespace hangs in `Terminating` with nothing left to
release it.

Deleting the CRDs takes every Engine, RuleSet, RuleSource and RuleData on the
cluster with them, in any namespace — not only `waf-perf`. Use `--keep-crds`
on a cluster you share. Helm never removes a chart's `crds/` itself, on
uninstall or upgrade, so this is always an explicit step.

Istio and the GatewayClass are left alone, on both platforms, and have to go
by hand:

```bash
oc delete gatewayclass openshift-default      # OpenShift: the ingress operator's OSSM
istioctl uninstall --purge -y                 # Kubernetes
```

On OpenShift that GatewayClass is what made the cluster ingress operator
install OSSM in the first place, so removing it affects every Gateway on the
cluster, not just this harness's. Read `scripts/prereqs/install-istio.sh`
before you do.
