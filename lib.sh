# failing with "no image found in image index for architecture arm64".

# Set these to run a build of your own, which also opts out of the resolution.

# a cluster working; it does not pin a reported number, which is why the

# Why the pairing matters at all. The chart's CRDs are pinned to the chart
# version, the image is not, and a build newer than the chart needs fields the
# chart has never heard of. Chart 0.5.0 ships rulesources and ruledata with no
# status subresource, so a newer operator writes RuleSource status into an
# endpoint the API server does not serve and every patch comes back "not
# found" — naming the object, not the schema. The RuleSet then waits on a
# validation that can never arrive and waf.sh times out on
# 'oc wait ruleset --for=condition=Ready'. See docs/prerequisites.md.
